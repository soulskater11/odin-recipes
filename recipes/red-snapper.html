<h2>Description</h2>
      
    <p> Red snapper is a lean, meaty fish that is perfect for baking. This main dish comes together 
        in less than half an hour and is a healthy and flavorful option any night of the week. This 
        easy fish recipe is baked with a simple combination of garlic, butter, seasoned breadcrumbs, 
        and Parmesan cheese.
    </p>

    <p> This red snapper recipe is easily doubled or tripled for a family meal. If you're closely 
        watching your saturated fat intake, you can swap up to half of the melted butter for 
        extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with a grain, like quinoa or roasted potatoes, and a steamed 
        green vegetable, like green beans.
